These are my copies of the Udacity TensorFlow notebooks that I worked through to get my feet wet with TF. 

Notebook 1: NotMNIST
    This workbook is primarily a utility one used to make sure the dataset is downloaded, unzipped and processed into numpy arrays stored in a set of pickle files. We also validated the data by rendering the arrays, ensured everything was shuffled correctly and split into acceptable training and testing sets. Finally we did a simple logistic regression using SciKit's model to establish a baseline (with a final score of 86% accuracy on 10,000 samples trained.)
