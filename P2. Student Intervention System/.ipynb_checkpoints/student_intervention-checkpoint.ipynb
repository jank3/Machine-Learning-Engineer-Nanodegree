    "- What is the theoretical O(n) time & space complexity in terms of input size?\n",
    "\n",
    "From our lecture, k Nearest Neighbors tends to have a very low training cost of O(1) in terms of time since it simple loads the data to the model. The memory cost is linear with the size of the training sample or O(n). The trade-off is that the query time is higher since the model needs to find the appropriate point and identify the appropriate points with an O(log(n) + k) although the memory remains constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the general applications of this model? What are its strengths and weaknesses?\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is different than Decision Trees since it is instance based and doesn't try and produce a model of the data (instead just polling k training data points that are nearest the queried point to see which class they fit into). Since there is no underlying model, this means that KNN can better represent iregular decision boundaries (since there is no need for a very complex equation to have been modeled) but this is a two edged sword since outliers can skew the boundary or create an area of false positives behing the primary boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given what you know about the data so far, why did you choose this model to apply?\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit's documentation indicates that KNN has been applied in a large number of situations succesfully where other models may have difficulty approximating a function to model the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fit this model to the training data, try to predict labels (for both training and test sets), and measure the F<sub>1</sub> score. Repeat this process with different training set sizes (100, 200, 300), keeping test set constant.\n",
